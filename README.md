# Country picker prototypes

This project explores patterns for country pickers that use data from open registers.

## Building and running

This is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit), so most instructions that apply to that work here too. In short:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:openregister/picker-prototypes.git
cd picker-prototypes
npm i
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Tested on node `v7.x`, and npm `v4.x`.
